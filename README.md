# pytorch_retinanet
A simple implementations of `Retinanet` for `object detection` as described in the paper [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002).

> This project uses [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
> For trainig it is recommended to use : [PyTorchLightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning). Ready to use scripts will be utilizing PyTorchLightning.
> I also plan to use [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) to maintain my config files and [Albumentaitons](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations) for image transformations.

## TODO: 
- [x] Create `Anchor Generator`.
- [x] Create `ResNet` based `BackBone Model`.
- [x] Create `FPN` architecture as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144.
- [x] [Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) & `Regeression` and `Classification` Head for `Retinanet`.
- [x] Assemble Retinanet Using `BackBone` => `FPN` => `AnchorGenerator` => `Regeression` & `Classification` Head.
- [x] Decode `Retinanet Predictions`. 
- [x] Create `Dataset` for Loading Custom Data. [Preferably from CSV].
- [x] Test model training on toy dataset.
- [x] Check `Training`. [Failing: in losses.py : cuda error]
- [x] Fix `cuda` errors in losses.py
- [x] Evaluation using `COCO API`. (scripts taken from: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/wheat)
- [x] Fix `nan` losses during training.
- [ ] Train on Pascal VOC 2007.
- [ ] Ready made easy to use scripts for `training` & `inference`.
- [ ] Train on COCO dataset. (Not sure if I have the resources)

## Updates
- Started Training on [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) ran to many errors. ðŸ˜­
- Fixed the errors was able to train on the [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). Reached a mAP of 0.5 before Colab resources ran out. I plan to update the notebooks in the `references` soon.
- 27 August 2020:
  - Started training on [Pascal VOC 2007](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html).
  - Ran into errors mainly due to albumentations removing boxes.
  - Fixed my image transformation pipeline.
  - Useg PyTorchLightning Trainer : it's just awesome. ðŸ˜Ž 
  - Trainining is going on smoothly. [notebook](https://github.com/benihime91/pytorch_retinanet/blob/master/references/train_pascal_2007.ipynb).
